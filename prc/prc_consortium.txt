- Skill Points: 4 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Base Attack Bonus: +6
Feats: Dodge, Ambidexterity, Mobility, Weapon Proficiency: Martial, Rogue or Elf.

Known Issues:

  -Enhanced Mobility could not be implemented
  -Deflect Arrows wasn't working correctly, so it was replaced with a free Spring Attack feat
  -Elaborate Parry would have required a heartbeat script to work like the PnP version.  So, instead of giving an AC bonus when parrying, it simply gives a bonus to parry skill.
  -Epic levels aren't from official material.


******************** Hierophant *******************
A divine spellcaster who rises high in the service of his diety gains access to spells and abilities of which lesser faithful can only dream.

  -The feats involving transfer of abilities were not implemented.
  -Blast Infidel and Faith Healing work by alignment, not diety, since the former is much more commonly used in NWN.

*************** Updates ****************

V1.8:
* Hierophant, Red Avenger, Duelist

V1.7:
* Added Lich Template, and Shifter from Hennessy, and Disciple of Mephistopheles from Attilla.

V1.6:
* Combined with Stratovarius's and Attilla's pack.

V1.5:
* Oozemasters!

V1.4:
* Spell-Like ability. Permanently stores a spell as a spell-like ability
  to use 2 times per day. This also allows for caster only spells, like
  greater stoneskin, to be casted on other targets. This is not as it
  was meant to work, but I find no way to remove it and it's so damn
  nice anyway :) And it compensates for the lacking Arcane Reach

V1.3:
* Arcane Fire feat. Target your victim with the feat, cast any spell
  (remember that spell level adds to damage) and watch the pain!
  Subject to range attack check but not spell resistance.

V1.2:
* Mastery of Shaping is a togglable power now(make sure you DO toggle it
  when you learn it).
* Mastery of Elements feat selection are now organized in subfeats

V1.1:
* Fixed a bug that prevented both SpellPower and Mestry of Shaping to work
  (this was really stupid sorry ...)
