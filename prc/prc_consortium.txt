HIGH ARCANA:
Each level the Archmage must choose one of the following High Arcana feats:
* Arcane Fire: This feat allows the Archmage to convert any spells he knows into a powerful bolt of raw magical energy.

* Spell Power: This feat allows the Archmage to increase his effective caster level by 1 (commutative with the normal level bonus they get).

The duelist is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier.  Also known as the swashbuckler, the duelist always takes full advantage of his quick reflexes and wits in a fight.  Rather than wearing bulky armor, duelists feel that the best way to protect themselves is to not get hit at all.

- Hit Die: d10
- Proficiencies: A duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but does not gain any armor or shield proficiencies.
- Skill Points: 4 + Int Modifier.

Known Issues:

  -Enhanced Mobility could not be implemented
  -Deflect Arrows wasn't working correctly, so it was replaced with a free Spring Attack feat
  -Elaborate Parry would have required a heartbeat script to work like the PnP version.  So, instead of giving an AC bonus when parrying, it simply gives a bonus to parry skill.
  -Epic levels aren't from official material.

Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn.

Most elemental savants start out as wizards, although clerics and druids are not unknown. Sorcerers occasionally take this prestige class, but since metamagic feats are of less utility to them, they have difficulty using the class's strengths to the fullest.

Mystra, the diety of magic, is one of the patron dieties of the Harpers; her predecessor was one of the dieties who met at the Dancing Place centuries ago to inspire the founding of the organization. With such a rich magical tradition, it is inevitable that the Harpers would develop some of their own magical lore and techniques to pass on to their agents.

They learn not only combat skills as might be taught a warrior, but also spells that target the weaknesses of their foes. Some use traps, others use weapons, but all hone their magical skills to a fine point, for it is those skills that distinguish them from the usual run of hunters and killers.

******************** Oozemaster *******************
The oozemaster is not a class for stable individuals. It involves relating one-on-one with things that relate to nothing at all. Unlike the animal lord's kindred creatures, the oozemaster's charges have nothing to say. No one has yet developed a speak with ooze spell- or if someone has, the oozes haven't responded. Given that oozemasters exude everything but confidence, most of them have few sentient friends and even fewer guests. Thus, they tend to gibber and talk to themselves a lot.

******************** Shifter (PnP Version) *******************
A shifter has no form they call their own. Instead, they cloth themselves in whatever shape is most expedient at the time. While others base their identities largely on their external forms, the shifter actually comes closer to their true self through all of their transformations. Of necessity, their sense of self is based not on their outward form, but on their soul, which is truly the only constant about them. It is the inner strength of that soul that enables them to take on any shape and remain themselves within.

(This version was created more closely to PnP guidelines. All available forms can be shifted into via verbal commands. The list of available creatures is here: http://www.nwnlexicon.com/compiled/other.resource.html Essentially, everything.)

Epic Shifter
The epic shifter has gone beyond the normal druidic ability to wildshape; no longer does she simply assume a new form when she changes shape. The epic shifter actually becomes the new creature. Epic shifters are rarely encountered in their true form; indeed, some of the most ancient and powerful shifters claim (with some pride) to have forgotten their true form entirely.

Epic shifters are generally a wild and carefree lot, and they prefer to spend their time exploring the multiverse and reveling in new forms and shapes they discover along the way.

- Hit Die: d8.
- Skill Points: 4 + Int Modifier.

Level 11: Epic Greater Wildshape - Can turn into almost anything twice a day, gaining some abilities of some of the forms. The epic shifter gains two uses of this feat every three levels above 11.

* Hierophant, Red Avenger, Duelist
* Bug fixes

V1.7:
* Added Lich Template and Shifter from Hennessy and Disciple of Mephistopheles from Attilla.

V1.6:
* Combined with Stratovarius's and Attilla's pack.

V1.5:
* Oozemasters!

V1.4:
* Spell-Like ability. Permanently stores a spell as a spell-like ability to use 2 times per day. This also allows for caster only spells, like greater stoneskin, to be cast on other targets. This is not as it was meant to work, but I find no way to remove it and it's so damn nice anyway :) And it compensates for the lacking Arcane Reach

V1.3:
* Arcane Fire feat. Target your victim with the feat, cast any spell (remember that spell level adds to damage) and watch the pain! Subject to range attack check but not spell resistance.

V1.2:
* Mastery of Shaping can now be toggled on and off. (make sure you DO toggle it when you learn it).
* Mastery of Elements feat selection are now organized in subfeats

V1.1:
* Fixed a bug that prevented both Spell Power and Mastery of Shaping from working.
