TO DO BUILDS USING A WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT:
============================================

Open a windows command prompt cd into your prc directory.  Use notepad
(or any other text editor) to create a file called config.make.  Add the 
following 2 lines to the file:

NWN_DIR = C:\games\neverwinternights\nwn
PRC_VERSION = 19

Where the value for NWN_DIR is the directory where NWN is installed and
the value of PRC_VERSION is the revision number of the prc pack you
are building. (only Stratovarius really needs to use this, the rest of
us can set it to some random number, it's only used to make the RAR)

To run the build just type "make", this will build the pack and install
all of the appropriate files in your NWN directory.  If you want to
make the RAR type "make rar".




TO DO BUILDS USING CYGWIN:
==========================

What do you need:
The command line erf tool available at:
http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1053576776593.shtml
which is use dot .. well .. create the erf&hak files :)

The command line script compiler(modified a bit by me to
play nicely with make) at:
http://www.t-o-m-e.net/tmp/nwnnsscomp.zip

Put the executables somewhere and edit config.mk to point to them.
Also make it point to your neverwinter directory(so it can automatically
copy the neccesary files to override/tlk)

THen you're done.

just type:
* To compile:
	make scripts
* To create hak/erf(this will compile if needed)
	make pack
* To install in override/tlk(this will compile if needed)
	make install

(This requires cygwin with make installed)

If you want to do it manualy .. well your loss :)
