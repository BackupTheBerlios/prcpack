    <li>High Arcana*</li>
  </ol>
<p>Bonus Spells</p>
<p>The Archmage sacrifices the bonus spell slots he should 
gain in order to take a High Arcana feat at each level. He does, however, add 
his level to his base caster class when determining spell power (damage, 
duration ...).</p>
<p>HIGH ARCANA:</p>
<p>Each level the Archmage must choose one of the following 
High Arcana feats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arcane Fire: This feat allows the Archmage to convert 
any spells he knows into a powerful bolt of raw magical energy.</li>
    <li>Mastery of Elements: This feat allows the Archmage to 
change on the fly the damage type of any elemental spells. The feat to set them 
back to normal is free at level 1, the fire, cold, acid, electrical and sonic 
damages are separated in their own feats and must be selected.</li>
    <li>Mastery of Shapes: This feat allows the Archmage to 
create &quot;holes&quot; in her area of effect spells to protect his companions from the 
effects.</li>
    <li>Spell-Like ability: This feat allows the Archmage to 
permanently prepare a spell as a spell-like ability which she may then use 2 
times per day.</li>
    <li>Spell Power: This feat allows the Archmage to increase 
his effective caster level by 1 (commutative with the normal level bonus they 
get).</li>

    <li>Enhanced Mobility could not be implemented</li>
    <li>Deflect Arrows wasn't working correctly, so it was 
replaced with a free Spring Attack feat</li>

skills to a fine point, for it is those skills that distinguish them from the 
usual run of hunters and killers. They develop friendships with the sorts of 
people who can lead them to their foes, but they place the dirty business of 
overcoming those foes on their own shoulders.</p>

<p>A shifter has no form they call their own. Instead, they 
cloth themselves in whatever shape is most expedient at the time. While others

comes closer to their true self through all of their transformations. Of 
necessity, their sense of self is based not on their outward form, but on their 
soul, which is truly the only constant about them. It is the inner strength of 
that soul that enables them to take on any shape and remain themselves within.</p>

<p><i>Notes on Mordenkainen's Magnificient Mansion:&nbsp; This 
spell works by creating an instance of a custom placeable object where you cast the 
spell.&nbsp; I tried to write this in such a way that it would be friendly with 
servers that have multiple parties; to do this I implemented the mansion 
in a pseudo-instanced manner.&nbsp; The ERF actually contains 6 instances of the 
mansion, when someone enters a mansion the scripts use the next mansion in 
sequence, going round robin through all 6 mansions looking for one that is 
unoccupied by any players (if all mansions are occupied then the spell will 'fail' when 
the user tries to enter a mansion and he will get a &quot;no vacancy&quot; message).&nbsp; This 
allows multiple parties to cast MMM and each get their own mansion.&nbsp; If you need 
more than 6 instances of the mansion for your server, all you have to do is 
create a copy of one of the mansion areas and change the tag of the exit door to 
MordsMansExitxx where xx what number mansion that is. (DO NOT change the tag 
of the area, the spell script expects all the mansions to have the same tag so 
it can prevent someone from casting MMM from within a mansion)&nbsp; For example the 
mansions that come with the ERF are MordsMansExit01, MordsMansExit02, ..., 
MordsMansExit06.&nbsp; If you need more just number your copies in sequence, 
MordsMansExit07, MordsMansExit08, etc.&nbsp; If you need less feel free to delete some of the 
mansions, just make sure the numbering of the exit areas remains consecutive, i.e. if 
you want 5 mansions delete the area with MordsMansExit06.&nbsp; The scripts will 
dynamically determine the number of mansions you have as long as the doors are 
numbered in sequence.</i></p>
<p><i>IMPORTANT NOTE:&nbsp; If you leave items behind in a mansion, 
they are deleted.&nbsp; Make sure you don't leave anything behind!</i></p>

  but I find no way to remove it and it's so damn nice anyway :) And it 
  compensates for the lacking Arcane Reach</li>
</ul>
<p>V1.3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arcane Fire feat. Target your victim with the feat, cast any spell 
  (remember that spell level adds to damage) and watch the pain! Subject to 
  range attack check but not spell resistance.</li>
