What do you need:
The command line erf tool available at:
http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1053576776593.shtml
which is use dot .. well .. create the erf&hak files :)

The command line script compiler(modified a bit by me to
play nicely with make) at:


Put the executables somewhere and edit config.mk to point to them.
Also make it point to your neverwinter directory(so it can automatically
copy the neccesary files to override/tlk)

THen you're done.

just type:
* To compile:
	make scripts
* To create hak/erf(this will compile if needed)
	make pack
* To install in override/tlk(this will compile if needed)
	make install

(This requires cygwin with make installed)

If you want to do it manualy .. well your loss :)
